# non-confirmed user, this will not work for sign-in
non_confirmed_user:
  email: nonconfirmed@example.org

#
# Note:
#
# this is all that is needed to be able to sign in a user "user" within a controller test, like this:
#
# sign_in users(:regular_user)
#
# where 'sign_in' is a Devise helper method
#
regular_user:
  email: regular@example.org
  confirmed_at: 2015/01/01

# setting the email and encrypoted password - it turns out these are not needed for logging in with Devise's sign_in
# within controller tests! only the "confirmed_at" field is needed, Devise checks that the user is 'confirmed'
admin_user:
  email: admin@example.org
  encrypted_password: p456
  confirmed_at: 2015/01/01
  admin: true

# again the 'encrypted_password' (and email) fields aren't needed for controller tests, but the code below shows how
# to set the encrypted password with 'digest'
test_user:
  email: test@example.org
  encrypted_password: <%= User.new.send(:password_digest, '123greetings') %>
  confirmed_at: 2015/01/01
