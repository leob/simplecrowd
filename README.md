# README

The ultimate goal of the Simplecrowd project (still heavily under construction) is to provide a complete Crowdfunding
platform: a database-backed Ruby on Rails web application with the following functions/features:

* responsive across devices
* login/signup, user profiles
* create projects with rich text and media support
* search functionality
* donation and online payments
* social networking integration
* messaging built in

This README should (will) provide a quickstart on how to:

* set up a local development environment
* set up a cloud development environment using a service like Codio
* optimal development flow, testing, gotchas, tips and tricks
* deploy the application to a cloud environment like Heroku
